# Medical-Hackers

# Problem : 
In rural areas people don't have enough money to go for a regular heart checkup every time and even in urban areas this is always a queue in government hospitals and delays in getting appointment in private hospitals for a heart checkup. Because of this, the rates of heart diseases are increasing at an alarming rate especially in countries like India. 

# Idea/solution : 
Our theme for this hacakathon is based on integrating medical analysis with concepts of Computer Science. We are going to build an app which can predict the type of heart disease based on ECG signal. The ECG signals can easily be recorded through mobile phones using any microprocessor based device. The device will collect the data and send it to the server for predictions. App also contain the stats of the heart like heart rate , heart beat etc. to make the used more aware of their heart condition.
